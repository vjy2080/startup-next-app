     "subtitle":"Improve SEO and performance",
     "description":"`Server-side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) are two powerful techniques used in modern web development to enhance performance and SEO. SSR involves rendering web pages on the server before sending them to the client. This means that the content is fully rendered on the server and sent as a complete HTML document to the user's browser, making it highly beneficial for SEO. Search engine crawlers can easily index the content without needing to execute JavaScript, improving the likelihood of better search rankings. Additionally, SSR can significantly reduce the time it takes for users to see content on their screens, as they receive a fully rendered page quickly.SSG, on the other hand, involves generating static HTML pages at build time. When a user requests a page, the server delivers a pre-rendered HTML file rather than generating the page dynamically. This approach results in faster load times since static files are quicker to serve compared to dynamically generated content. It also reduces server load and allows for efficient caching strategies, further enhancing performance. SSG is particularly effective for content that doesn’t change frequently, as it eliminates the need for server-side rendering on every request.Both SSR and SSG offer unique advantages and can be used together to leverage their strengths. SSR is ideal for dynamic content that benefits from server-side rendering, while SSG is perfect for static content that benefits from faster load times. By incorporating both techniques, developers can create web applications that are not only fast and responsive but also optimized for search engines, providing an overall superior user experience. These methods also facilitate better control over content delivery and scalability, making them essential tools for modern web development.`"

By breaking down the application into smaller chunks, Automatic Code Splitting ensures that users only download and execute the code that is required for their current interaction, rather than loading the entire application upfront.This technique is particularly useful in managing large and complex applications where loading the entire codebase could lead to performance bottlenecks and slower page loads. Code splitting helps in optimizing resource loading by deferring the loading of non-essential code until it is needed. This results in a more efficient use of network resources and a better user experience, as pages and features load faster and respond more quickly.Automatic Code Splitting is typically integrated into the build process using tools and bundlers that analyze the application's dependencies and determine how to split the code effectively. This process allows for on-demand loading of resources, which can lead to improved performance and reduced server load. Overall, Automatic Code Splitting is a key technique for modern web development, helping to create faster and more efficient applications that provide a seamless user experience.`"
